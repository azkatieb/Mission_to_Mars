The purpose of this repository was to hold the files related to Module 10 Web Scraping Challenge. We used our skills with html, mongoDB, python, Splinter, and Jupyter notebook to scrape data from a NASA website to learn more about Mars and then creaete our own webpage using the Flask app to display the information we scraped from the website.
